# Reflection

## Instructions

_Please answer at least one question from each section below as a team. Answers here will likely be inspiration for the “lessons learned” section of your project presentation at the end of the unit._

## Design

* How closely did you follow your design document after the review was complete? Did your implementation need to change based on what you learned once you were underway?
  1. We followed our design document very closely and only omitted a single design choice.
  2. Implementation didn't seem to change, but retrospection allowed us to remove a single use case.

## Project

* How did you handle the ambiguity of defining your own project and user stories? What strategies did you use to decide on concrete work to do to
  satisfy your requirements?
  1. We initially created pinpoint stories. With help from our scrum master, we envisioned broader user stories to cover entire feature/function.
  2. Created acceptance criteria.
  3. Worked on user stories in pairs.
* How did you deal with getting stuck on a problem? What strategies did you employ to get yourself unblocked?
  1. Used many resources (online, teammates for fresh perspective, scrum master(Jean)).
* Did any of your commitments you made in your team charter help navigate a difficult decision, situation, or collaboration challenge? How?
  1. Our dependability, structure, and clarity area helped us achieve our group goals.
  2. When stuck we were able to break down big problems into smaller ones and distribute the workload.

## Scrum

* What did you find to be the most valuable part of daily stand-ups? Is there anything you would want to do differently at stand-up to make it more useful to you?
  1. Discussing blockers each day was a great way to say out loud to our team where we are in the code and keep us on the same page.
  2. Was a great way to see where and what everyone was working on.
  3. I think we covered all the bases in our daily stand-ups.
* Did you over or underestimate the work you could complete during your sprints? What have you learned that will help you better estimate work next time?
  1. We were able to complete what we set out to accomplish each sprint. 
  2. We definitely underestimated certain story points for some user stories.
  3. Using codebases that we have little to no understanding of may take a little time to understand how they interact with other code.

## Looking ahead

* If you were to start this unit over again, what would you do differently? How do you see yourself applying that to your work in later units, the capstone, or your internship?
  1. Not refactor the whole code-base. Instead, add new files to the existing structure.
  2. I think we all see the value of an already working code-base.
