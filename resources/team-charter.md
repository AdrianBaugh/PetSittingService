# Team Charter

## Instructions

_Answer the questions below and fill out the process sections with your team’s mechanisms to follow your answers. Remove the italicized examples text as you go._

_On real world software teams, you will often create a document like this via a process called [reteaming](https://www.agilealliance.org/resources/experience-reports/dynamic-reteaming-how-we-thrive-by-rebuilding-teams/). Having something that captures the goals and concerns of everyone on a team helps the team work more efficiently together._

## Purpose

* Psychological safety
* Dependability

### Psychological safety

* **How can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or embarrassed?**

* **How do we address situations where any team member feels unsafe?**
  _With strong communication and checking in with one another. Find a way to resolve problems quickly instead of letting them hang around._

### Dependability, Structure, Clarity

* **How can we count on each other to do high quality work on time?**

* **How do we address missed deadlines?**
  _Figure out what took the longest on a specific task, and learn from that by better estimating the time in the future._

* **How can we make goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?**
  _Following our design document and the project board so we don't steer away from the goals of the project. We can also check in with one another each day and make sure everyone is comfortable with their task and goals for that day._
